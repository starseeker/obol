 * \brief Enhanced thread-local storage with C++17 improvements
 * 
 * This header provides C++17-enhanced implementations for thread-local storage
 * while maintaining full compatibility with the existing cc_storage C API.
 * 
 * Key improvements over the original C implementation:
 * - Automatic thread cleanup using RAII and std::thread_local destructors
 * - Enhanced thread safety using C++17 threading primitives
 * - Better exception safety in constructor/destructor callbacks
 * - Global storage registry for comprehensive thread cleanup
