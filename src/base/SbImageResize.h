  \brief Image resizing utilities for the Coin3D image format system.
  
  This header provides centralized image resizing capabilities that can be
  used by format handlers and other parts of the system. It provides both
  high-quality and fast resizing algorithms with unified filter control.

/*!
  \brief Unified resize filter/quality options for image resizing.
  
  This enum combines both legacy quality levels and specific filter types
  into a single unified interface. Legacy quality options are maintained
  for backward compatibility:
  
  **Legacy Quality Options:**
  - SB_IMAGE_RESIZE_FAST: Fast nearest-neighbor scaling
  - SB_IMAGE_RESIZE_BILINEAR: Bilinear interpolation
  - SB_IMAGE_RESIZE_HIGH: High quality using Bell filter (same as SB_IMAGE_RESIZE_FILTER_BELL)
  
  **Specific Filter Types:**
  - SB_IMAGE_RESIZE_FILTER_BELL: Excellent balance of quality and performance  
  - SB_IMAGE_RESIZE_FILTER_B_SPLINE: Smooth results, good for photographic content
  - SB_IMAGE_RESIZE_FILTER_LANCZOS3: Sharp results, excellent for preserving fine details
  - SB_IMAGE_RESIZE_FILTER_MITCHELL: Good general-purpose filter with balanced sharpness
*/
