# Test Consolidation Plan

## Overview

This document tracks the ongoing reorganization of the Obol test suite into the
proposed two-tier framework. Sessions should update the status tables and
check off completed items as work progresses.

## Target Architecture

```
obol_unittest     – non-graphical unit tests; subcommand pattern
                    Usage: obol_unittest [list|run <name|cat>|help]

obol_render       – rendering/visual tests; produces control images
                    Usage: obol_render [list|run <name> <outpath>|run_all <dir>|help]
                    Single image OR a series of images per test.

obol_viewer       – interactive FLTK viewer (unchanged)
                    Shows all render tests with full interactivity.
```

**Key constraint**: every `obol_render` test must also work in `obol_viewer` with
meaningful interactivity.  Tests that currently show only a static scene must be
updated to include interactive elements (pick targets, draggers, animated content,
etc.) so the viewer user can see the feature in action.

---

## Implementation Status

### Phase 1 — Infrastructure (New Executables)

- [x] Add `render_sequence` field to `TestEntry` (test_registry.h)
- [x] Create `tests/obol_unittest.cpp`
- [x] Create `tests/obol_render.cpp`
- [x] Update `tests/CMakeLists.txt` to build `obol_unittest` and `obol_render`
- [x] Update `tests/rendering/CMakeLists.txt` — point `add_rendering_image_test`
      at `obol_render` instead of `obol_test`

### Phase 2 — Shadow Test Consolidation

The `render_shadow.cpp` test uses `ObolTest::Scenes::createShadow` (testlib
factory) and is already `add_testlib_rendering_test`.

The `render_shadow_advanced.cpp` test builds its **own** 4-scenario scene
inline, duplicating scene-graph logic already present in
`ObolTest::Scenes::createShadowAdvanced`.  The `obol_viewer` renders
`createShadowAdvanced` correctly.

- [x] Refactor `render_shadow_advanced.cpp` to use `createShadowAdvanced`
      factory for its primary image and retain inline sub-tests as validation
      passes only (no duplicated scene graph).
- [x] Change `add_rendering_test(render_shadow_advanced)` →
      `add_testlib_rendering_test(render_shadow_advanced)`.

### Phase 3 — Standalone → Testlib Render Test Conversions

The 62 standalone `add_rendering_test` tests below each build their own scene
graph, despite having matching `create_scene` factories registered in the
`TestRegistry`.  Converting them to use the shared factory ensures the viewer
and the CLI image-generation path render **identical scenes**.

**Important constraint**: Tests that have existing control images
(`tests/control_images/<name>_control.png`) cannot be converted simply by
swapping in the testlib factory.  The testlib factories call `cam->viewAll()`
after setting a fixed camera position, whereas the original standalone tests
used fixed camera positions only.  The `viewAll` call adjusts the camera
distance to frame the scene's bounding sphere, producing a different (larger)
rendered object.  The RMSE difference between factory output and the original
control image can exceed the 15.0 RMSE threshold.

**Conversion strategy for tests with control images:**
1. Convert the test source to use the factory.
2. Render the new output and commit updated control images alongside the source.
3. Widen the RMSE threshold in `add_rendering_image_test` if the factory's
   `viewAll` camera framing produces measurably different output.
   Alternatively, update the factory to match the old camera framing.

Tests without control images can be converted freely (done = ✅, safe = 🔓).

Priority order: tests whose standalone scenes already closely match the factory
output go first (marked **easy**).  Tests that run multiple sub-scenarios and
cannot be represented as a single scene go last (marked **hard**).

### Phase 4 — Interactive Elements for Visual Tests

Every `obol_render` test must be interactable in `obol_viewer`.  Most tests
already have `has_interactive = true` and include pick targets or camera
controls.  The list below tracks tests that may need explicit interaction
support added (e.g., picking callback, visible state change, animated element).

**Currently `has_interactive = false`:**
- `hud` (the HUDOverlay factory) – needs button callbacks or animated HUD text

**Tests where current interactive support may be insufficient** (static scene,
nothing to "do" in the viewer beyond camera orbit):
- `gradient` – pure background; needs a foreground interactive element
- `colored_cube` – smoke test; fine for basic orbit but needs pick target
- `sphere_position` – diagnostic check; fine as-is
- `checker_texture` – needs at least a pick-to-toggle behavior
- `switch_visibility` – should show a way to toggle the switch interactively
- `shape_hints` – could benefit from a pick-to-toggle hints button
- `environment` – should show animated fog density or light change
- `depth_buffer` – needs an interactive depth comparison element
- `alpha_test` – needs pick-to-toggle alpha threshold visualization
- `view_volume_ops` – camera manipulation already interactive; fine as-is

**Tests with strong interactive requirements (render_sequence needed):**

These tests verify *behavioral* changes and need multiple frames to show
interactions.  `obol_render` should produce a frame sequence; `obol_viewer`
should support the corresponding live interactions.

| Test                         | Interaction sequence needed                                      |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| render_pick_interaction      | frame 0: no selection; frame 1: sphere picked (highlighted)     |
| render_pick_filter           | frame 0: no selection; frame 1: sphere picked; frame 2: blocked |
| render_selection_interaction | frame 0: no sel; frame 1: sphere sel; frame 2: multi-sel        |
| render_lod_picking           | frame 0: close; frame 1: medium dist; frame 2: far dist         |
| render_draggers              | frame 0: default pos; frame 1: translated; frame 2: rotated     |
| render_simple_draggers       | frame 0: default; frame 1: drag applied                         |
| render_light_manips          | frame 0: default; frame 1: light moved                          |
| render_manip_sequences       | frame 0: base; frame 1: manip attached; frame 2: moved          |
| render_arb8_draggers         | frame 0: default; frame 1: corner dragged                       |
| render_arb8_edit_cycle       | frame 0: step 0; frame 1-3: edit steps                          |
| render_camera_interaction    | frame 0: perspective; frame 1: ortho; frame 2: zoomed           |
| render_scene_interaction     | frame 0: base; frame 1: node added; frame 2: node removed       |
| render_ext_selection         | frame 0: no sel; frame 1: lasso; frame 2: bbox                  |
| render_ext_selection_events  | frame 0: no sel; frame 1: rect sel; frame 2: part bbox          |

### Phase 5 — Viewport / Quad-Viewport Tests (New Factories Needed)

These tests lack matching testlib factories entirely:

- `render_viewport` — needs `createViewport` factory
- `render_quad_viewport` — needs `createQuadViewport` factory  
- `render_scene_texture_multi_mgr` — needs `createSceneTextureMultiMgr` factory

---

## Current Known Issues

### Shadow Tests

The `render_shadow_advanced.cpp` standalone test creates `SoShadowGroup` with
`getCoinHeadlessContextManager()` in each sub-test, whereas
`ObolTest::Scenes::createShadowAdvanced` creates it without any argument.
The viewer successfully renders `createShadowAdvanced`, confirming the factory
is correct.  The standalone test's extra `getCoinHeadlessContextManager()` call
was added to work around an earlier issue and is no longer needed (the context
manager is set globally by `initCoinHeadless()` before any rendering).

**Action:** Done – see Phase 2 ✅.

### Missing `render_sequence` Support

Currently `TestEntry::create_scene` returns a single static `SoSeparator*`.
There is no mechanism to drive a sequence of rendered frames from a single test
registration.  Adding `render_sequence` (Phase 1, implemented) provides this
capability; individual tests still need their sequence callbacks populated
(Phase 4).

## Session Log

### Session 1 (2026-03-03)
- Performed full analysis of existing test infrastructure (317 REGISTER_TEST
  calls, 100 visual / 213 unit, 41 testlib-backed render tests, 62 standalone)
- Identified shadow consolidation issue: `render_shadow_advanced.cpp` does not
  use `createShadowAdvanced` testlib factory
- Identified `render_sequence` gap: no mechanism for multi-frame interaction
  testing  
- **Completed:**
  - Created this document
  - Added `render_sequence` field to `TestEntry` in `test_registry.h`
  - Created `tests/obol_unittest.cpp` (non-graphical unit test runner)
  - Created `tests/obol_render.cpp` (rendering test runner)
  - Updated `tests/CMakeLists.txt` to build both new executables
  - Fixed `render_shadow_advanced.cpp` to use testlib factory +
    changed to `add_testlib_rendering_test`
  - Updated `tests/rendering/CMakeLists.txt` `add_rendering_image_test` macro
    to use `obol_render` instead of `obol_test`
  - Converted 3 tests without control images to use testlib factories:
    `render_cubemap`, `render_gl_big_image`, `render_multi_texture`
- **Key finding:** Tests with existing control images cannot be trivially
  converted — the testlib factories call `cam->viewAll()` after setting a
  fixed camera position, which moves the camera closer than the standalone
  test's fixed position, producing ~32 RMSE difference (threshold: 15.0).
  These tests need control image regeneration in a future session.

### Session 2 (2026-03-03)
- **Phase 3 bulk conversions (no control images):** 32 tests converted using
  standard basepath-injection pattern. All inject the factory scene render at
  the top of main() before existing behavioral sub-tests:
  - Standard basepath tests: field_connections, engine_converter, engine_interaction,
    sensors_rendering, sensor_interaction, text3_parts, ext_selection, nodekit_interaction,
    scene_interaction, camera_interaction, event_callback_interaction, selection_interaction,
    pick_interaction, pick_filter, lod_picking, bbox_action, callback_node, event_propagation,
    shader_program, offscreen_advanced, render_manager_full, glrender_deep,
    glrender_action_modes, view_volume_ops, search_action, callback_action,
    path_operations, callback_action_deep, ext_selection_events
  - Void-argc pattern: write_read_action, raypick_shapes
  - Inline-root pattern: arb8_draggers, hud_interaction, rt_proxy_shapes, background_gradient
- **Phase 3 control-image-regen tests (10 tests):**
  Converted and regenerated control images for: texture3, bump_map, texture_transform,
  shape_hints, environment, depth_buffer, alpha_test, scene_texture, procedural_shape,
  arb8_edit_cycle. Strategy: inject factory render as primary output, keep behavioral
  multi-frame tests for validation only (not written to primary outpath).
  For arb8_edit_cycle: factory writes primary `.rgb`; inline step 4 now writes to
  `_step4.rgb` (not compared to control) to avoid overwriting the factory output.
- **Phase 5 remaining (5 tests need new factories):**
  render_viewport, render_quad_viewport, render_quad_viewport_lod, render_viewport_scene,
  render_scene_texture_multi_mgr — no testlib factories exist yet.

### Session 3+ (planned)
- Phase 4: implement `render_sequence` callbacks for pick/selection/dragger tests
- Phase 5: add missing viewport scene factories + conversions
- Final review and cleanup
