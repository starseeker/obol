  \brief Abstract base class for all sensors.

  \ingroup coin_sensors

  SoSensor is the base for the Obol sensor hierarchy.  Sensors are
  callback objects that fire when a scene-graph condition is met (a
  node changes, a field changes, a timer fires, etc.).  The callback
  function and user data are set via setFunction() and setData().
