# Generate control images for visual regression tests.
#
# Each rendering test produces an SGI RGB file via SoOffscreenRenderer.
# This script converts each RGB output to a lossless PNG for compact
# repository storage.
#
# OUTPUT NAMING CONVENTION (in control_images/):
#   <test_name>_control.png
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
#   - Xvfb available (or DISPLAY already set to a working X11/GLX display)
#   - Coin library on LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or installed)
#   - rgb_to_png and image_comparator built in BUILD_DIR/bin/
#
# ENVIRONMENT:
#   BUILD_DIR   - path to CMake build directory (default: <script_dir>/build)
#   CONTROL_DIR - output directory (default: <script_dir>/control_images)
#   DISPLAY     - X11 display (auto-starts Xvfb on :99 if unset)
