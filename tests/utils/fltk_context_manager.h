/*
 * FLTKContextManager: Cross-platform OpenGL context manager for Obol
 * that delegates context creation to FLTK's Fl_Gl_Window.
 *
 * FLTK abstracts the platform-specific GL context setup:
 *   - WGL on Windows
 *   - CGL / NSOpenGL on macOS
 *   - GLX on X11 / Linux
 *
 * Preferred mode (setExternalWindow):
 *   The caller (obol_viewer) passes its own Fl_Gl_Window – typically the
 *   CoinPanel rendering widget – via setExternalWindow() before the first
 *   render.  The manager then calls make_current() on that window instead
 *   of creating a separate hidden context window.  This mirrors the pattern
 *   used by cube.cxx in the FLTK test suite: a real, visible Fl_Gl_Window
 *   is created and shown by the caller; FLTK's GL context lifetime is then
 *   tied to that visible widget rather than to a synthetic off-screen window.
 *
 * Fallback mode (own hidden window):
 *   If setExternalWindow() is never called the manager creates a small
 *   hidden 1×1 Fl_Gl_Window lazily on the first render request, as before.
 *   This preserves backward compatibility for environments that do not use
 *   the external-window path.
 *
 * Offscreen rendering uses framebuffer objects (FBOs) managed by the Obol
 * library; the FLTK window surface itself is never drawn to directly by
 * this context manager.
 *
 * This header provides drop-in replacements for the same functions that
 * headless_utils.h exposes for the system-GL / GLX path:
 *
 *   initCoinHeadless()              – initialise SoDB with the FLTK manager
 *   getCoinHeadlessContextManager() – return the installed context manager
 *   getSharedRenderer()             – return a shared SoOffscreenRenderer
 *
 * Compile obol_viewer with -DOBOL_VIEWER_FLTK_GL to select this header
 * instead of headless_utils.h for the system-GL panel.  The GLX header
 * (included by headless_utils.h) is then not required by the viewer itself,
 * which means the viewer can build and run on any platform that FLTK
 * supports without needing Xvfb or a direct X11 connection.
 *
 * Note: on Linux/X11 the getProcAddress() implementation still calls
 * glXGetProcAddress() directly because that is the standard GL extension
 * function loader on that platform regardless of which code created the
 * GL context.  The libGL / OpenGL::GL link target is therefore still
 * required on Linux even when using this FLTK-based manager.

 *     manager simply calls w->make_current() on that window.  This mirrors
 *     the cube.cxx FLTK example pattern and avoids the off-screen hidden-
 *     window approach that can fail in certain CI / headless environments.
 *
 *   Fallback / hidden-window mode:
 *     If setExternalWindow() is never called a small hidden 1×1
 *     FLTKGLContextWindow is created lazily on the first render request
 *     (the original behaviour), preserving backward compatibility.
